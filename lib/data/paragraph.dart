Hello, my name is Donn Jayson Quinto, as a college student fascinated by the intersection of technology and human interaction, HCI has been a captivating subject for me. I am eager to introduce myself, discuss my interests, and outline my goals related to HCI and app development. From an early age, I was inspired by the design and their functionality which triggered my curiosity in taking this course, Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. I want to understand how the software works and learn to create it, creating software that can also trigger their curiosity and inspire the users to learn it and see the future beyond us and what technology is waiting for us to integrate into our lives.  I've always been deeply interested in computers and technology. I was fascinated by the endless possibilities they offered, which sparked a lifelong passion for exploring the digital world.
As I learned more about technology, I discovered the power of coding. Writing code became my creative outlet, allowing me to solve problems and bring innovative ideas to life. I realized that programming is like an art, with limitless potential. I also believe in growing as a whole person. Empathy, kindness, and building meaningful connections are important to me. I think technology should not only advance but also bring people together and make their lives better. So, I combine my tech skills with these values in my life. In the big picture, I see myself as someone who weaves together technology and humanity. Every day is a chance to learn, create, and connect, and I'm excited to be part of the ever-changing digital world that has captured my heart and mind.
I am deeply passionate about understanding software, how to create them, and what characteristics of it that can be impactful and meaningful. This subject Human-Computer Interaction significantly contributed to my skill and knowledge about creating application/software, user-centered design principles, and gaining hands-on experience in creating user-friendly and impactful designs. My long-term goal is to pursue a career in UX/UI design or front-end development. I see these areas as the perfect blend of my passion for aesthetics and my love for coding. By combining my skills in visual design with my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I aim to create immersive and delightful user experiences.
Whether it's designing intuitive mobile apps or developing responsive websites, I want to be at the forefront of the ever-evolving digital landscape. I am constantly seeking opportunities to grow and learn, whether through attending design workshops, exploring new design tools, or collaborating with fellow designers and developers. I believe that staying curious and adaptable is essential in such a fast-paced industry. With my dedication, enthusiasm, and willingness to push boundaries, I am confident that I can make a meaningful impact and contribute to the evolution of digital experiences. Thank you for taking the time to explore my self description. I am eager to share my passion for Human-Computer Interaction and application development and demonstrate the valuable insights I have gained throughout my studies.
